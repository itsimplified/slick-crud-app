# slick-crud-app
This is a simple Python CRUD application that uses data (https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/addresses.csv) from the Department of Scientific Computing at Florida State University along with Flask and SQLite3 to teach simple MySQL queries.

### Application Notes:
This CRUD application provides MySQL query code for simple database operations performed by the user via a GUI.  These simple database operations are ideal for beginners to create and maintain small databases.  The user can insert data into a table, delete data from a table, edit data in a table, and list data in a table.  When the user performs these operations in the GUI, the corresponding query code is displayed.

This application is meant to be simple for demonstration purposes only.  The goal is to give you a foundation on how to build a Python web application that connects to an SQLite database.  In addition, if you are not familiar with MySQL queries, it will give you a basic understanding of this as well.  It is probably not going to be much useful beyond this purpose.  Hopefully, after reviewing this code you will be on your way to building amazing Flask web applications using SQLite.
